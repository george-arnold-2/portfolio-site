I’m also a dedicated long-distance runner, which fits my goal-oriented nature and helps me maintain both physical and mental resilience. When I’m not running or spending time with my son, I enjoy playing D&D with friends and hosting trivia games. I was often the “trivia guy” at my last job, organizing virtual and in-person trivia events to bring teams together."
